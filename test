 I'm trying use NLP LLM model to build summary on the KPI metrics on Key value pair. Can you suggest any model to do that? 
it has numbers as well.
this has performance metrics pulled on daily basis. Need to get the daily summary (aggregated) .


{
    "name": "ProUpliftPercent",
    "editable": {
        "storagelevel": "inputlevel",
        "enablepastweeks": false,
        "editmode": "all",
        "code": "LIFT"
    },
    "distribution": {
        "timehierarchydisttype": "equal",
        "planhierarchydisttype": "equal",
        "distributionorder": "TimeThenPlan"
    },
    "display": {
        "subsets": [
            "Planning",
            "VPC"
        ],
        "round": 2,
        "enabled": true
    },
    "compoundmain": false,
    "aggregation": {
        "timerule": "formula",
        "skippeddimensions": [
            "Tactic"
        ],
        "rule": "formula"
    }
}
